### 📚 About  
This repository contains the code and experiments for my seminar thesis in the **Probabilistic Machine Learning** course (SoSe 2025).  
The work focuses on exploring **uncertainty** in neural networks using **partial Bayesian neural networks**, with a particular emphasis on:

- **Bayesian last-layer** (Neural Linear Approximations)  
- Comparison to fully deterministic neural networks  
- Evaluation of **uncertainty calibration** and **overconfidence** on in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) data

---

### 🛠️ Core Topics
- Probabilistic modeling in neural networks  
- Bayesian linear regression as output layer  
- Predictive entropy and epistemic uncertainty  
- OOD detection via uncertainty quantification  
- Comparison to MAP-trained deterministic models

### To set up the project environment and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
```
  bash:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/probabilistic-seminar.git
  cd probabilistic-seminar
```
2. **create virtual environment**
```
  # on Mac os:
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate

  # on Windows: 
  venv\Scripts\activate
```  
3. **install dependencies**
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run experiments**
   
  For simluation study:
    Open and run ```src/Simulation.ipynb```
  
  For real-world classification:
    Open and run ```src/RealData.ipynb```


### 📊 Datasets Used
- **Synthetic (toy) regression dataset** — for visualizing predictive uncertainty  
- **Real-world dataset**
  - Diabetes Diagnosis: available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset-legit-dataset)
  - In-distribution: known label classes  
  - OOD: unrelated or random inputs for uncertainty evaluation

---

### 📌 Goal of the Work
To evaluate whether a simple Bayesian approximation (only in the last layer) is sufficient to capture meaningful uncertainty in predictions — particularly in OOD settings — and to compare its behavior to a fully deterministic ReLU network.
