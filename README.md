# Probabilistic Machine Learning Seminar: 
## Baysian Neural Networks
_Repository for Course Code and Projects_

## 📚 About
This repository contains my work for the Seminar I'm attending during this semester, focused on **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)**.  
The aim is to explore uncertainty modeling in neural networks using Bayesian principles, with special emphasis on:
- **Partially Stochastic Layers**  
- **Stochastic Last Layers**

Throughout the course, I'll implement theoretical concepts, experiments, and small projects related to these topics.
